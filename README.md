# Backstage
Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals

## What is Backstage?
Backstage is an open platform which unifies all your infrastructure tooling, services, and documentation to create a streamlined development environment from end to end. 
In simple words, it manages all your software, in one place. We will have one front end for all our infrastructure.

## Getting Started
To start using Backstage, see the [Getting Started documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/).
